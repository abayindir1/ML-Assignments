 Please go to https://github.com/abayindir1/ML-Assignments/tree/main/Assignment-1 and download test-data.xlsx and training.xlsx files to the same folder as part1.py and part2.py. I tried to link these files directly from github, however for some reason it did not work and I could not fix it. So I had to do it this way.

After putting excel files and python files in the same folder, do "pip install scikit-learn" "pip install pandas" and "pip install numpy". For part 2, I used sklearn as my ml library.

After installing depencencies, you can run python files and print results that I had. 

You can access to original data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set
I changed the data a little bit.
