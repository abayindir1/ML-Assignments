the program shows a plot of model history and the results of the model in tabular format. I think the best activation functions were logistic with learning rate 0.01 and 200 max iterations and tanh with learning rate 0.01 and 200 max iterations. They gave the same results. I say that they are the best because they have the lowest test MSE among activations methods. They also have high test accuracy.
